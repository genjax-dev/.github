# Hi there! ðŸŽ²

We develop:
* [GenJAX](https://github.com/genjax-dev/genjax-chi), an open-source probabilistic programming system with compilation to GPUs and TPUs.

We also publish papers on elements of our system:
* [Probabilistic programming with programmable variational inference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3656463), a new design for parametric variational inference (VI) which supports programmability of VI objective functions, unbiased gradient estimators for those functions, and variational families.
